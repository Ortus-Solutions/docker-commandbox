- `HEADLESS` environment flag now assigns a [CommandBox secure profile](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/embedded-server/configuring-your-server/server-profiles) of `production`, rather than using a custom rewrite file.

### Added

- Added multi-architecture builds to support both x86_64 and ARM architectures
